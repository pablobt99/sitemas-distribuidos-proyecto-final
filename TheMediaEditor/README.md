# MediaEditor
A MediaEditor (Images and possibly Videos) focused on using the MVC, Command and Observer design patterns 

## Requirements:

1. Contain (in memory) a collection of image assets, that is initially empty;
2. Allow the user to load one or more image assets into the collection;
3. Display thumbnails of all assets stored in memory in a top-level GUI window (ie
‘CollectionView’);
4. Allow the user to select one of the image assets (by double-clicking a thumbnail) in the
CollectionView for display inside a second GUI window (ie ‘DisplayView’);
5. The DisplayView should be resizable, and the selected image asset should auto-scale to fit the
window;
6. Allow the user to scale, rotate, and flip the selected image asset via the DisplayView;
7. Allow the user to save the processed image to a file, with a user-supplied path/filename.
